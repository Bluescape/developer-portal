<h1>Permissions</h1>

<h3>Organizations</h3>

<p>
    All members of an organization are assigned a role that governs the permissions they have to modify the
    organization. There are four role types in an organization - Owner, Admin, User and Guest.

<h4>Owner</h4>

<p>
    The owner of the organization has the ability to add, delete and modify users and update organizational settings.
    They also have the same functionality as a user of the organization. The owner cannot be removed from the organization,
    and they will always be an administrator for this organization. The owner of the organization, along with admins, can modify organization
    settings.
</p>

<h4>Admin</h4>

<p>
    Admins have the same capabilities as the owner. The owner and other admins can make any organization 
    member an administrator by opening the user's settings and checking the option for administrator. Admins 
    also have the ability to modify organization settings.
</p>

<h4>User</h4>

<p>
    A User in an organization has the ability to view any public workspace shared within an organization, any private
    workspace they own or have been invited to, and have the ability to create new workspaces. They can also invite collaborators
    into workspaces that they own or to which they have “share” access.
</p>

<h4>Guest</h4>

<p>
    Guest users in an organization can only see the workspaces they have been invited to; they cannot see any public
    workspaces in the organization. In the workspaces that they have been invited to, they have the same abilities as a
    regular user.

    <strong>Additional Notes</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Bluescape users can be a Guest, User, Admin, or Owner in any number of organizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the context of an SSO organization, only Users authorized in the company’s Identity Provider (IdP) will
            be allowed access – for example, if an Admin adds a User who is not authorized in the IdP, they will receive
            an error when they try to log in.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Workspaces</h3>

<p>
    When users are invited to collaborate on a workspace, the permissions they have to modify content and invite other
    users to the workspace are governed by the workspace role they are assigned. There are six role types in a
    workspace - Owner, Editor+, Editor, Commenter, Viewer, and Template.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
    <th>Owner</th>
        <td>The Owner of a workspace has the ability to edit workspace settings, export the workspace, and even change the organization that
        the workspace belongs to, along with a variety of other management actions such as the ability to
        delete or change ownership of a workspace. Only the Owner role can perform these actions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Editor+</th>
        <td>This role allows users to fully collaborate within the space with no restrictions on adding, removing,
            modifying, or downloading assets from the workspace. They can add and remove collaborators in the workspace along with being able to edit their roles.

                        In the current <span class="pre">/v3/</span> GA version, listeners are not available. 
                        This functionality has been replaced with GraphQL subscriptions.

</p>    

<p>
Please note that Listeners are valid only for <span class="pre">v2</span> REST API endpoints.<br />
In <span class="pre">v3</span> you will use <a href="/docs/page/graphql-subscriptions">GraphQL Subscriptions</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a table of the event types that can be subscribed to when creating listeners. More details about Listeners can be found in the <a href="/docs/page/listeners-api">Listeners page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Please remember that the term "Listener" must be understood from your perspective, as the API user interacting with a Workspace: you will set a Listener to listen to events that occur in that Workspace.
